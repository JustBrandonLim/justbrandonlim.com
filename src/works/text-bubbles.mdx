## Tech Stack

1. React

   - I chose [React](https://react.dev/) because I am comfortable with its ecosystem, and I also do not require the features that other React frameworks offer.

2. TailwindCSS
   - I chose [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as it is a utility-first CSS framework and allows me to rapidly style my web application.

## Motivation

As a tech-savvy individual, I have always wanted to venture into content creation. I wanted a way to put subtitles on my videos.
