## Tech Stack

1. Next.js

   - I chose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as I am a big fan of [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)'s products and its developer experience. In addition, I am also very comfortable with [React](https://react.dev/)'s ecosystem.

2. TailwindCSS
   - I chose [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as it is a utility-first CSS framework and allows me to rapidly style my website.

## Design

I opted for a simple and minimalistic design, along with support for light and dark modes, as I wanted to explore more. The website uses very few colours, such as black, grey, and white, for its colour theme.

## Motivation

I wanted a digital garden to showcase my capabilities, as well as learn more about web development.
