## Tech Stack

1. C++ with Win32 APIs

   - I chose [C++](https://cplusplus.com/) because of its speed and interoperability with [Win32 APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/).

## Motivation

While I was experimenting with automation on a game, I realised that the synthesised inputs that I sent out were detected. I decided to create a tool to learn how I could detect synthesised inputs.
