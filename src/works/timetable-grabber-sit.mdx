## Tech Stack

1. C# with WPF

   - This was the tech stack used in the first release of **Timetable Grabber - SIT**.

2. Electron.js

   - I chose [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) as it uses technologies that I am familiar with, such as HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

3. TailwindCSS

   - I chose [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as it is a utility-first CSS framework and allows me to rapidly style my application.

## Design

- I opted to follow Singapore Institute of Technology's [colour scheme](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/identity/colours) so that students who use the application feel more comfortable.

## Motivation

I created it so that I am able to export my weekly schedule to my phone's calendar since IN4SIT lacks the feature to export our weekly schedule to our calendar of choice.
