## Tech Stack

1. Next.js

   - I chose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as I am a big fan of [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)'s products and its developer experience. In addition, I am also very comfortable with [React](https://react.dev/)'s ecosystem.

2. TailwindCSS
   - I chose [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as it is a utility-first CSS framework and allows me to rapidly style my web application.

## Design

Gathering inspiration from Next.js, I wanted to try replicating their theme.

## Motivation

I wanted to try something fun, such as [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), and gamify something much simpler.
