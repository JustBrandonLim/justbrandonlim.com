## Why would I want to kill NodeJS?

Have you ever ran into the problem of NodeJS instance complaining
about port 3000 already being used?

> Port 3000 is already in use.

This is when you might want to look for and kill any ghost NodeJS processes.

## Why does this happen?

Of course, if you don't have a terminal with NodeJS running on port 3000, the error would mean that
there is a ghost process of NodeJS running in the background without your knowledge.
This especially happens on MacOS quite often, as you might accidentally press `CMD + Q` to quit without
stopping NodeJS properly first.

## How do we do it?

Depending on your operating system, the steps might differ. Refer below for the commands.

```zsh title="Unix"
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 xxx
```

```batch title="Windows"
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID xxx /F
```
