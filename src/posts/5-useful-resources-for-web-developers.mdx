## 2. Simple Icons

In addition, they also provide you with the brand guidelines, colors and many more download options.

Every web developer will at some point find a need to use a brand icon. What could be better than a collection of every brand's logo in SVG format?

[Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) contains over 2000 SVG icons for popular brands. They provide you with the functionality of searching for a specific brand and also allow you to copy the SVG to paste in your code directly.

In addition, they also provide you with brand guidelines, colours, and many more download options.

## 3. Heroicons

If you loved TailwindCSS, you will definitely love this one as well.

Crafted by the makers of TailwindCSS, [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) offers a collection of commonly used icons such as hamburgers, crosses, arrows, and many more. They have a simple yet intuitive user interface that allows you to copy either as an SVG or JSX to use directly in your code.

You won't ever have to worry about paying for any icon packs again.

## 4. Web Code Tools

Ever struggled to create your own Open Graph or Twitter meta tags? This tool will solve all your problems.

[Web Code Tools](https://webcode.tools/) offers an array of generators, such as:

- CSS
- HTML
- Meta Tags
- Structured Data
- Open Graph
- Twitter Card
- robots.txt

With this amazing tool, you will be able to generate meta tags quickly and write less code.

## 5. OpenGraph

Prior to this tool, I had to go to a few different websites just to preview my meta tags, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Discord.

With [OpenGraph](https://www.opengraph.xyz/), you can now preview your meta tags all in one place. All you have to do is simply enter your URL, and it will show you all the previews at once.

They also feature editing and copying of meta tags. This can help you save time tremendously.
