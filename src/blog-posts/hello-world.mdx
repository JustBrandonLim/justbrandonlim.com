## What is "Hello, World!"?

"Hello, World!" is a program used to mainly illustrate a language's basic syntax.
It is what students first write when learning a new programming language.

## How do you do it then?

Here are some examples of "Hello, World!" written in a few programming languages.

```c title="C" {4}
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```

```cpp title="C++" {4}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

```csharp title="C#" {9}
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    public class Example
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}
```

```java title="Java" {3}
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

```python title="Python" {1}
print("Hello, World!")
```

```javascript title="JavaScript" {1}
console.log("Hello, World!);
```
