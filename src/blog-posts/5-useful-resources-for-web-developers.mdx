[Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) is amazing for any web developers who needs inspiration.
They provide you with a curated collection of colour palletes that you can use for your projects.
You can even filter the palletes by popularity, date added and many more.

In addition, they also provide a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly access color palletes
while on the web.

## 2. [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org)

Every web developer will often at some point find a need to use a brand icon. What can be better than
a collection of every brand's logo in SVG format?

[Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) contains over 2000+ SVG icons for popular brands. They provide
you with the functionality of searching for a specific brand, and also allows you to copy the SVG to
paste in your code directly.

In addition, they also provide you with the brand guidelines, colors and many more download options.

## 3. [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com)

If you loved **TailwindCSS**, you will definitely love this one as well.

Crafted by the makers of **TailwindCSS**, [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) offers a collection of
commonly used icons such as hamburgers, crosses, arrows and many more. They have a simple yet intuitive
user interface which allows you to copy either as a SVG or JSX to use directly in your code.

You won't ever have to worry about paying for any icon packs again.

## 4. [Web Code Tools](https://webcode.tools)

Ever struggled to create your own **Open Graph** or **Twitter** meta tags? This tool will solve all your problems.

[Web Code Tools](https://webcode.tools/) offers an array of generators such as:

- CSS
- HTML
- Meta Tags
- Structured Data
- Open Graph
- Twitter Card
- Robots.txt

With this amazing tool, you will be able to generate meta tags quickly and write lesser code.

## 5. [OpenGraph](https://www.opengraph.xyz/)

Prior to this tool, I had to go to a few different websites just to preview my meta tags such as
**FaceBook**, **Twitter**, **LinkedIn** and **Discord**.

With [OpenGraph](https://www.opengraph.xyz/), you can now preview your meta tags all in a single
place. All you have to do is simply enter your URL and it will show you all the previews in one go.

They also feature editing and copying of meta tags. This can help you save time tremendously.
