      <p>
        I fell in love with programming at the age of 12, when I got my first computer. Ever since then, I have been honing my skills. I am passionate
        about creating innovative solutions that make people&apos;s lives easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I occasionally work on my own ideas that I think are innovative to further my skills. Usually, if I am not programming, you
        can find me at the gym working out or staying at home playing my favourite video games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am trying to write more posts and also practise my problem-solving skills on LeetCode. I am also looking at creating content on
        YouTube to share my programming knowledge.
