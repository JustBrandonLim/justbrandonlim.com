This is my digital hub created with Next.js, TailwindCSS and deployed with Vercel.

## To-Do List

- Compress to `.woff2` when Vercel supports it for dynamic image generation.
- Use `edge` runtime instead of `nodejs` runtime for dynamic image generation.
- Add styling and support for code line numbering on MDX.
- Add view and like counts for works and posts. (TBC)
